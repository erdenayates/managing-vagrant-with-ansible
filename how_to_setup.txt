In this lab we will have 5 small Ubuntu instances by Vagrant.
Vagrantfile will provide us these instances, they all will be different IP addresses from 192.168.56.100 to 192.168.56.104.
When you in the same directory with Vagrantfile, if you type "vagrant up" to terminal. These 5 instances will be created soon.
If you have got limited source on your computer, you can delete some instances from Vagrantfile, even 2 instances will be enough for that lab.
In examples sometimes i have used db01, web01 and sometimes i used "all" parameter show doing the same thing on the every instances.
When you want to lake a look inside of instance, you can make it with "vagrant ssh instance-name" in your terminal.

"hosts" file is acting like phone book. Like when you say "i want to call Erdenay", you take a look to your phone book. 
With Ansible hosts file does the same, when you say with your playbook, "i want to remove these files in db01 instance" Ansible takes a look
to your hosts file and matches IP address so than actions will be happend.
